# bond-convexity-sim
A tool to view and analyze the convexity of a bond.

## Contributing notes
The project avoids committing binary artifacts (images, spreadsheets, notebooks) so the
GitHub-style PR flow in this environment remains compatible. If you need to surface
plot outputs or other visuals, prefer text-based formats (CSV/JSON for data, Markdown
for screenshots with links to generated artifacts) or regenerate the assets locally
instead of checking them into git.
